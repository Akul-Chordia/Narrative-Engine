# The Narrative Engine
## A game engine for story tellers
I've seen a lot of story teller/writer based tools such as twine which usually aim at providing easy text editing and story creation for making interactive story content. Unfortunately, this is often limited to text only, and with some coding ability, writers make 2d stories too. This engine is intended to try to solve that- make a game engine for writers that can easily allow them to create stories in 3D worlds without the hassle of coding. Of course this comes with a lot of limited features and scope but at the benefit of having tools targeted solely towards telling a story or narrative.

Currently in it's first few weeks of development.

Features accomplished:
1. Scene loading, editing, saving
2. Scene rendering

What's next?
1. Player movement, control
2. UI and text displays

This engine is meant to be a hobby project for my portfolio. If you have any suggestions, let me know at sachinkishan02@gmail.com or Twitter- @SachinKishan9
