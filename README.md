# The Narrative Engine
## A game engine for storytellers
I've seen a lot of storyteller/writer-based tools such as Twine which usually aim at providing easy text editing and story creation for making interactive story content. Unfortunately, this is often limited to text only, and with some coding ability, writers make 2D stories too. This engine is intended to solve that- make a game engine for writers that can easily allow them to create stories in 3D worlds without the hassle of coding. Of course, this comes with many limited features and scope but it has the benefit of having tools targeted solely towards telling a story or narrative.

Features accomplished:
1. Scene loading, editing, saving
2. Scene rendering
3. Point lights
4. Multi-point support
5. Object picking using ray casting(through the use of dynamic box SDFs)
6. Window resizing support
7. Player movement
8. Interactable "event" points that users can customize for different outcomes and conditional events. 
9. Player collectible objects and an inventory system
10. Scene changing system
11. A "game builder" that builds game files and provides a file to execute the game along with an executor for the game
12. An executor application that can execute game files

What's next?
1. The Narrative Engine is opening up for public contributions! Watch this space for updates.


This engine is meant to be a hobby project.
